Bootstrap 3.2.0
===============

[Bootstrap 3.2.0](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) packaged for [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) 0.9+

Packaged by [Tim Pfafman](https://github.com/pfafman/meteor-bootstrap-3)


### Installation

```
meteor add pfafman:bootstrap-3
```

#### Why another package of this?

I needed boostrap 3 on meteor 0.9 and the package there was not working.  Also looks like a fair amount of thinking to get the [less version](https://github.com/simison/bootstrap3-less/) of this to work.
